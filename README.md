## :book: How To... Use the Guide

The Updated Guide is divided into 6 sections. You can peruse it on your own without refering to the app, based on what you want to implement.

For searching via the search term from the App, there are 2 ways:

### If you have a user in GitHub

...when you see a feature that you would like to implement, copy or take note of the search term (e.g., **#SearchTermExample**) and perform a search in the Repository. Clicking on a result brings you to the markdown code of the respective Guide, so just click on the Preview and search for the term again.

### If you *don't* have a user in GitHub

Alternatively, you can search for an annotation in the Guide/Wiki, get the search term, and use it to locate the UI feature in the app. If the annotation cannot be found, it could simply mean that it is not showcased in the current release.
